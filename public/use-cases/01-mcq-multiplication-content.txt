MULTIPLICATION TABLES REFERENCE (0-100 range)

This use case focuses on creating multiple choice questions for multiplication facts within the 0-100 range, covering:

BASIC FACTS (0-12 tables):
- 0 × any number = 0
- 1 × any number = that number
- 2 × numbers (doubling)
- 5 × numbers (ending in 0 or 5)
- 10 × numbers (adding zero)
- Square numbers: 6×6, 7×7, 8×8, 9×9
- Common combinations: 3×4, 6×8, 7×9, etc.

DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION:
- Easy: Single digit × single digit (2×3, 5×4)
- Medium: Single digit × teens (7×12, 9×11)
- Hard: Larger combinations within 0-100 (12×8, 15×6)

COMMON STUDENT ERRORS TO USE AS DISTRACTORS:
- Off-by-one errors (7×8=55 instead of 56)
- Addition instead of multiplication (7×8=15)
- Confusion with similar facts (6×7 vs 6×8)
- Pattern errors (thinking 9×6=56 because of 8×7)

TARGET: Create questions that help students master multiplication facts systematically while identifying common misconceptions.
