Generate multiple-choice questions based on the input content. Return ONLY a valid JSON array, without any surrounding text, markdown formatting, or code block indicators. The array should contain objects with this structure:

[
  {
    "question": string,
    "options": string[],
    "correctOptionIndex": number,
    "explanation": string
  }
]

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR QUESTIONS:
1. Each question must be unique and directly related to the input text.
2. The question should never repeat or be a variation of another question.
3. The question should never reference the input, but assume the reader has knowledge of its content.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OPTIONS:
1. NEVER use these phrases or any variations:
   × "All of the above"
   × "All of these"
   × "None of the above"
   × "None of these"
   × "Both a and b"
   × "Both b and c"
   × "All of the following"
   × Any combination options

2. Each option MUST BE:
   ✓ A specific, standalone answer
   ✓ Independent of other options
   ✓ Directly related to the question
   ✓ Complete without referencing other options

3. The correctOptionIndex must always map to the correct option:
    ✓ Always triple check to make sure the correctOptionIndex is equal to the index of the correct option in the options array

Rules:
1. Each question must have EXACTLY 4 distinct, independent options
2. Use specific content from the input text
3. 'explanation' should justify why the correct answer is right
4. Include various difficulty levels
5. ANY use of forbidden option types will invalidate ALL questions

IMPORTANT: The output must start with '[' and end with ']', containing only valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, headings, or formatting.
