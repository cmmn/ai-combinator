[TRANSCRIPT BEGINS]

Mike: Thanks everyone for joining. We need to finalize our Q4 roadmap and make some hard decisions about feature priorities.

Alex: Before we dive in, I want to emphasize that our Series B depends on hitting our December metrics. We need 40% user growth and 25% revenue increase.

Sarah: From engineering perspective, we have capacity for about 3 major features this quarter. The mobile app optimization is taking longer than expected - probably need 6 weeks instead of 4.

David: The user research from last week shows that dashboard redesign should be our top priority. 73% of users mentioned navigation issues in the survey.

Jennifer: I agree, but we also promised the new integration features to our enterprise clients. We have three major deals pending on that - worth about $480K in ARR.

Mike: Let me walk through the options. Option 1: Dashboard redesign, enterprise integrations, mobile optimization. Option 2: Focus on just dashboard and integrations, push mobile to Q1.

Sarah: If we try to do all three, we'll probably ship everything late. I'd rather do two things well.

Alex: What's the revenue impact of delaying mobile?

Mike: Mobile users convert 23% higher, but our mobile user base is only 30% of total. Enterprise deals are guaranteed revenue.

David: Could we do a lightweight dashboard update instead of full redesign? Maybe just fix the navigation issues for now?

Sarah: That's doable. Maybe 3 weeks instead of 8 weeks for full redesign.

Jennifer: I like that compromise. We could also soft-launch the enterprise features to our pilot customers first.

Alex: OK, so we're looking at: lightweight dashboard fixes, enterprise integrations with pilot launch, and mobile optimization. Sarah, is that feasible?

Sarah: Yes, if we keep dashboard changes minimal and use the pilot approach for enterprise features. But I'll need one additional frontend developer.

Mike: I can reassign Jenny from the analytics project. She's been wanting to work on dashboard anyway.

Alex: Done. Jennifer, can you coordinate with our enterprise clients about the pilot timeline?

Jennifer: Absolutely. I'll reach out to them this week. Should have timeline confirmation by Friday.

David: One more thing - the dashboard changes need to be tested with our accessibility consultant. That's a 2-week turnaround usually.

Sarah: Good point. I'll reach out to them today to get on their calendar.

Alex: Anything else we need to resolve today?

Mike: Just the budget for the additional developer. It's about $15K for the quarter.

Alex: Approved. Mike, can you send around the final roadmap summary by end of week?

Mike: Will do. I'll include the timeline, resource requirements, and success metrics.

Jennifer: Should we schedule a check-in for October 1st?

Alex: Yes, let's do bi-weekly check-ins throughout Q4. Mike can set those up.
